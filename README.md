# findingdonors
This is my completion of the Jupyter Notebook "Finding Donors" assignment from the Udacity Nanodegree Data Science course.

My contributions are the answers to questions, as well as any code implemented below the #TODO lines. I implemented several variations of the code to yield the same results.

The data set used is the census.csv file, and the attached visuals.py contains pre-written code from the Udacity program to facilitate visuals.
